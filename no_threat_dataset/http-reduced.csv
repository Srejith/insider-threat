He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. The prime movers behind Stephen's suspicions against the bishops were the Beaumont family, headed by the twin brothers Robert, Earl of Leicester, and Waleran, Count of Meulan, who wished to be the main advisors of the king. Whatever Roger's position, Nigel's own position on Matilda is less clear, and it is possible that he was never as opposed to her as his uncle. In 1141, Nigel, along with his brother Alexander, was one of the supporters of Matilda who, after the capture of Stephen by Matilda's forces, reached an agreement with Henry of Blois to replace Stephen with Matilda on the throne. In 1131, though, he was listed in a papal letter as ""Nigel, the treasurer"", which securely establishes that he held the office at that date."

The scope of the work was to consolidate some areas of the intonaco at the eastern end of the building and partially remove the soot and dirt. Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay Michelangelo's colours rediscovered, that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of linseed or walnut oil which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.

Warelwast went blind after 1120, and following his death in 1137 was succeeded by his nephew, Robert Warelwast. Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent sanctions against the king. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents."

Whatever Roger's position, Nigel's own position on Matilda is less clear, and it is possible that he was never as opposed to her as his uncle. In 1141, Nigel, along with his brother Alexander, was one of the supporters of Matilda who, after the capture of Stephen by Matilda's forces, reached an agreement with Henry of Blois to replace Stephen with Matilda on the throne. In 1131, though, he was listed in a papal letter as ""Nigel, the treasurer"", which securely establishes that he held the office at that date."

An important, and possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The Groundstar Conspiracy (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. Lang's follow-up, Scarlet Street (1945), was one of the few classic noirs to be officially censored: filled with erotic innuendo, it was temporarily banned in Milwaukee, Atlanta, and New York State. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date."

He re-introduced ritual into the synagogue, but more contentiously opposed intermarriage. Friedlander and former congregation president Abraham Jonas persuaded the congregation to introduce a number of significant reforms in the service: they first adopted the Jastrow prayer book, and later the Reform movement's Union Prayer Book (though in a revised, less radical version published specifically for First Hebrew, and authorized by the Central Conference of American Rabbis). The performance engendered passionate responses from the congregation; according to Broude ""I don't know if anyone was neutral."
